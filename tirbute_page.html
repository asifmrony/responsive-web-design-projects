            <ul>
                <li>Muḥammad ibn ʿAbdullāh born in 570(isayi) at Mecca, Hejaz, Arabia</li>
                <li>Muhammad was orphaned at the age of six.[6] He was raised under the care of his paternal grandfather
                    Abd al-Muttalib, and upon his death, by his uncle Abu Talib.</li>
                <li>When he was 40, Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave,[8][9] and receiving his
                    first revelation from God.</li>
                <li>Three years later, in 610,[10] Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly,[11]
                    proclaiming that "God is One", that complete "submission" (islām) to God[12] is the right way of
                    life (dīn),[13] and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in
                    Islam.[14][15][16]</li>
                <li>The followers of Muhammad were initially few in number, and experienced hostility from Meccan
                    polytheists.</li>
                <li>He sent some of his followers to Abyssinia in 615 to shield them from prosecution, before he and his
                    followers migrated from Mecca to Medina (then known as Yathrib) in 622.</li>
                <li>This event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri
                    Calendar.</li>
                <li>In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina.</li>
                <li>In December 629, after eight years of intermittent fighting with Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an
                    army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca.</li>
                <li>The conquest went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed.</li>
                <li>In 632, a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage, he fell ill and died.</li>
                <li> By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam.[17][18]</li>
            </ul>

        <blockquote id="testimonial" cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad#Appearance">
            <p>"Allah's Messenger was neither very tall nor short, neither absolutely white nor deep brown. His hair was
                neither curly nor lank. Allah sent him (as an Apostle) when he was forty years old. Afterwards he
                resided in Mecca for ten years and in Medina for ten more years. When Allah took him unto Him, there was
                scarcely twenty white hairs in his head and beard."</p>
